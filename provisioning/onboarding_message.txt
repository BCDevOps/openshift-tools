Welcome to the BC Developers' Exchange OpenShift DevOps platform.

The following projects have been created for you

${project}

The GitHub user ${user} has the admin role for all of the above projects. This will permit him/her to manage/administer all aspects of these projects, including:

- adding/removing users to the projects (provided they are already members of the BCDevOps GitHub organization)
- assigning roles/access levels within projects
- creating and managing project resources such as pods, services, routes, secrets, etc.

The OpenShift web console can be accessed by logging into https://console.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca:8443; you'll be prompted for GitHub authorization.

OpenShift functions can also be accessed via the "oc" command line tool, which can be downloaded at the locations below for your platform of choice:

https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v1.2.1

Once downloaded and unzipped (to a location in your PATH), you can login using a login command that you can copy from:

https://console.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca:8443/console/command-line

The command will look similar to:

oc login https://console.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca:8443 --token=xtyz123xtyz123xtyz123xtyz123
